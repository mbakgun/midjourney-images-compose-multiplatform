Consumer apps do not have any complex structures or operations. They use the common UI layer (including ViewModel) and are responsible for creating [MjImagesApp](https://github.com/mbakgun/midjourney-images-compose-multiplatform/blob/e640ac5893478fa0b0b3ed6e71f2b3b66765ce0d/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/MjImagesApp.kt#L38-L38). MjImagesApp and the dependency of this Composable, [MjImagesViewModel](https://github.com/mbakgun/midjourney-images-compose-multiplatform/blob/e640ac5893478fa0b0b3ed6e71f2b3b66765ce0d/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/MjImagesViewModel.kt#L15-L15), works as same on all platforms.
